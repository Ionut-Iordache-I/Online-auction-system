# Online-auction-system
The program implements the similar functionalities of an auction house by offering customers the opportunity to view various products put up for auction, so that later through a broker who retains a commission, they can participate in the auction for various products they want. At the same time the administrators of such a system can add new products to the auction house, while brokers have the right to remove the products sold. The implementation uses some of the basic design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Builder, Observer in compliance with OOP principles such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
